# 👋 Hey there! I'm Matteo

```python
def about_me():
    return {
        "age": 20,
        "passions": ["Python 🐍", "Cybersecurity 🔒", "Mountain Life 🏔️"],
        "current_status": "Debugging life, one line at a time"
    }
```

## 🚀 Who Am I?
Just your average tech enthusiast splitting time between code and mountain trails! 
When I'm not ethically hacking stuff, you'll probably find me on some peak 
with my laptop in my backpack (yes, I'm that kind of nerd 🤓).

## 💻 Tech Stack
- Python is my daily bread and butter
- Cybersecurity tools (because who doesn't want to be Mr. Robot?)
- Learning path: anything that can make me a better Ethical Hacker

## 🏔️ When I'm AFK (Away From Keyboard)
- Trekking until I find the perfect spot to code with an epic view
- Skiing down slopes (sometimes I debug better at 6500ft!)
- Planning the next adventure between mountains and code

## 📚 Currently Learning
- Advanced Python tricks (because learning never stops)
- Penetration Testing
- New trekking routes (okay, not tech-related but still important!)

## 🎯 2025 Goals
- Become a certified Ethical Hacker
- Contribute to more open source projects
- Reach at least 10 new peaks

## 📫 Find Me
If you want to chat about Python, cybersecurity, or plan a tech-friendly hike, 
I'm always looking to connect with like-minded people!

> "Life is like debugging: sometimes you need to climb higher to see the problem from above" 
> - Me, probably on some mountain peak with a laptop

⚡ Fun fact: My favorite coding setup is at 6500ft elevation. Debugging works 
way better with a breathtaking view! 🏔️💻
